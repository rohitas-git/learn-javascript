## MOTIVATION:

Who in their right mind would prototype a programming language in JavaScript?!? It’s really not as crazy as it sounds. For starters, JavaScript is a powerful and flexible dynamic language with decent support for OO and functional programming. Granted, there are better programming languages out there that you could use. But what makes JavaScript an interesting option is the fact that it is the language of the web browser… and everyone has a web browser.


JavaScript is a prototype-based language
